# Roma-Bird

Roma-Bird is a fun and challenging arcade game inspired by the popular mobile game Flappy-bird. The game features colorful graphics inspired by my exchange semester in Italy. Give it a try and see how far you can fly!

Game was finished on 1.12.2022 with python 3.10.0 using only pygame. 

To play just download the file and press space to fly. 

Below you can see a little sniplet of how the game looks
